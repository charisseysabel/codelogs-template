### How `flex-basis` works.
[Very nice article that shone the light](https://gedd.ski/post/the-difference-between-width-and-flex-basis/) âœ¨

I encountered a problem where I needed to set a "fixed" width on a flex item while at the same time, letting all the other flex-items stretch as wide as the rest of the remaining space. I didn't want to use CSS Grid, because then I'd have to provide a fallback and I didn't think the problem was complicated enough to justify using a Grid (But I couldn't figure out what the simpler solution was before then).

To fix the problem, the flex-item in question needs to have its `flex-basis` set to some value, and have `flex-shrink` and `flex-grow` have a value of `0` (e.g. `flex: 0 0 250px`). Doing it this way allowed me to have a flex-item that has a fixed width of `250px` while still being inside a flex container.
