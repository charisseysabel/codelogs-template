### Caching basics
[Digital Ocean's cool article about the basics of caching](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/web-caching-basics-terminology-http-headers-and-caching-strategies)

There are different types of caches:
- application cache
- memory cache
- web cache
- browser cache
- Caching proxies
- reverse cache
- ISP cache (If I remember correctly, I read somewhere that ISPs store the most common IP addresses, so its easier to look them up!)

Benefits:
- Decreased network costs
- Improved responsiveness
- Increased performance on some hardware
- Availability of content during network interruptions

What can be cached?
- Static files (images, icons, etc.)
- Downloadable content
- Media files
- Stylesheets (although for a web app, this might not be ideal?)

What should NOT be cached?
- Files that frequently change
- Authentication cookies
- Sensitive data

Recommendations for selecting headers:
- Allow all caches to store generic assets
- Allow browsers to cache user-specific assets
- Do not cache time-sensitive content
- Provide validations (in the form of `ETAG`s & `Last-Modified`)
- Set long freshness time for supporting content
- Set short freshness time for parent content (e.g. the HTML file), this way it can respond to changes to supporting content quickly.

## ðŸ’­Open questions
- Are CSS Sprites still a thing? How does it compare to using SVG?
- How does "fingerprinting" work in webpack? in Gulp/Grunt? (Fingerprinting is a way to create unique identifier to filenames)
- When should items be validated/invalidated? How does a cache know when its content is stale?

Work-related:
- What is SI's cache policy?
- How are avatar's cached? Are they cached at all?

## ðŸ’¡Idea
- The Words Project website is purely static... how can I cache its contents if I ever deploy it outside of GH Pages?
