## ðŸŒ± Learnings
### SQL Basics

Learned keywords:
- `SELECT`: What do I want the query to return?
- `FROM`: Where do I get the data from?
- `AS`: For aliasing stuff..
- `WHERE`: The clause where you can do operations/conditions, etc
- `JOIN... AS`
- `LIMIT`: How many do I want to see?
- `ORDER BY` and `GROUP BY`
- `COUNT`: Function that counts how many something occurs in the database

A bunch of other handy operations:
- `AVG`
- `SUM`
- `MIN` and `MAX`


Resource:

Related:
- [Data integrity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_integrity) is important; we should have guarantee that every field in the db is correct throughout the data's lifecycle.

#### SQLite on the command line

- On a MacOS, `python` comes already installed with `SQLite3`. To run sqlite3 on the terminal:
```
sqlite3 [someDatabaseFile]
```
and from there on, I can do a bunch of operations on the database file itself!

## ðŸ’­Open questions

- [] My codelogs (this repo) contains what is called Front Matter... not exactly sure how it works... Why can I put it on a Markdown file (when it seems to be for .yaml files?)

## ðŸ’ŽHidden gems
- https://www.dataquest.io - Provides courses about data science
- https://www.anaconda.com - (Python/R) looks to be a platform to perform data science stuff (Didn't know that was a thing)
