# Codelog
A repo for my programming journey.

## What is a codelog?

A codelog is a log of problems I faced, the solutions I found, the resources I
discovered in the process and any open questions related to my learnings that I want to look up at some point.

## Why do I log?

Mostly as a form of reflection; to appreciate how much I have progressed and improved. I have mostly been tracking it on a physical notebook and although its a great tool, having my notes in a digital format will allow me to play with this data once I have enough to start with.

## System

Codelog number and date
```md
## Codelog #X - XXXX-XX-XX
```

All the things that I learned on this day can go here and I can be as detailed as I want.
```md
## Learnings
```

Mostly questions that may or may not be connected to my learnings that I would like to know more about / investigate down the road.
```md
## Open Questions
```

Things that I cool on the Internetz.
Doesn't matter if its related to anything.
```md
## Hidden gems
```

### Front Matter
